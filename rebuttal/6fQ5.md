- ## Q1: Visual experiments and case studies

Thanks for the great suggestion. Following it, we design a series of visual experiments as case studies to validate AIM's effectiveness. We create four synthetic FairML tasks with different bias types: each dataset contains two groups sampled from the same distribution, with Group #1 as reference. We induce group/individual-level biases to Group #2. For group-level bias, we adjust the class boundary to simulate group-based discrimination (different groups having different "thresholds" for positive outcomes). For individual-level bias, we flip labels for 10% of samples to simulate discrimination against individuals (similar individuals treated differently). This approach provides ground truth labels for each sample's bias status, enabling us to assess AIM bias attribution quality.

The figure below shows our results. Each row represents a dataset, labeled with bias type. The 1st & 2nd column display data and class distribution for group #1 and #2. The 3rd column shows ground truth bias distribution on group #2, with blue for unbiased and red for biased. The 4th column displays sample bias detected by AIM, with red indicating biased (AIM bias score > 0.5). We also annotate the bias detection accuracy of AIM w.r.t. ground truth in 4th-column subplot titles. It can be visually observed that AIM accurately detects both group- and individual-level bias, with bias detection accuracy ranging from 97.0% to 99.8%.

- ## Q2: How does AIM address dynamic scenarios

We want to thank the reviewer for pointing out this great future direction. Following most existing research efforts on FairML (as documented in recent surveys [1,2]), we focus on fairness issues concerning normal i.i.d. data in this work. Dynamic FairML is a highly challenging research problem that might require a new seperate investigation, and thus is out of the scope of this study. We totally agree with you that dynamic FairML is a highly valuable direction, and therefore, emphasized this point in "Appendix B.3 - Limitations and Future Works". We discussed the challenges in dynamic FairML and presented potential solutions for handling concept drift and efficiently updating bias estimations on streaming data. Please kindly refer to the paper for more details.
